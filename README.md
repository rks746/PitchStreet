# 📈 Stock Market Simulation Game Plan

---

## 🎯 Objective
To create an engaging stock market simulation where college students pitch their startup ideas, and an audience of "investors" buys and sells shares in these startups. The game will determine the most valuable company and the best investors based on their portfolio value.

## 🧩 Game Structure

### 🏁 Phase 1: The Pitchers (Startups)

#### 👥 Who participates?
- College students with startup ideas.
- Teams pitch their ideas to a panel.

#### 🏆 Selection Process:
- The top 5 best startup ideas are selected.
- We help these teams refine and improve their ideas and present a perfect pitch on event day.

#### 🏢 Company Registration:
- The 5 selected teams become "companies."
- Each company is assigned an initial stock price (either by the founders or based on pitch quality).

### 💼 Phase 2: The Investors (Stock Market Game)

#### 👥 Who participates?
- Anyone interested in investing (registered as teams or individuals beforehand).

#### 💰 Game Setup:
- Each investor/team gets a fixed amount of virtual cash (e.g., ₹10,000).
- Investors can buy and sell shares of the 5 startup companies.
- If more people buy a stock, its price increases.
- If more people sell a stock, its price decreases.

#### 📅 Event Day:
- The startup teams present their ideas to the investors in a 2-minute pitch.
- Investors decide which stocks to buy/sell based on presentations.
- The game runs for a fixed period (e.g., 2–3 hours).
- Stock prices are updated every 15 minutes.
